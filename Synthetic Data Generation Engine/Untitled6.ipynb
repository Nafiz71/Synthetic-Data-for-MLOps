        "- **Noise Floor:** Represents background interference from non-Wi-Fi sources. A higher noise floor can degrade connection quality.\n",
        "- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** Calculated as RSSI minus the noise floor. Higher SNR values denote better connection quality.\n",

        "- **RTS/CTS Threshold:** Controls the use of Request to Send/Clear to Send protocols to manage collisions in dense environments.\n",
